# BC Growth Curve Coercer
This is a project I completed for Natural Resources Canada as part of my 8 month coop from January 2017 to September 2017. 
It is publicly hosted with their permission to be used as an example of my abilites. 

### What it does
In forest carbon modelling, three inputs are required: forest inventory, forest growth and yield curves, and future harvest projections.
The purpose of this program is to force a link between the BC forest inventory and the BC forest growth and yield curves for the cases
where there is no natural link. In the documentation folder there is a word document which provides a lot more detail.

### Context behind the program
When I began this project, I had never written a line of C++ code. My employers were kind enough to give me the opportunity to learn 
a new programming language for this project. Start to finish, the project took roughly a month. This includes the time spent analyzing the
data to determine the patterns that constituted the nonmatching records, the time spent developing the coercion rules, and the time spent
revising the coercion rules after receiving feedback from the data supplier.
